📖 How It Works

**Core Protocol Flow:**
1. **Market Initialization**: Deploy global protocol with multi-signature governance
2. **RBAC Setup**: Initialize multisig, timelock controller, and governance registry  
3. **Reserve Creation**: Initialize asset-specific liquidity pools (requires role permissions)
4. **Liquidity Provision**: Users deposit assets and receive yield-bearing aTokens
5. **Collateral Deposits**: Users deposit aTokens as collateral for borrowing
6. **Borrowing**: Take loans against collateral value with health factor monitoring
7. **Interest Accrual**: Dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand utilization
8. **Liquidation**: Automated liquidation of unhealthy positions to maintain protocol solvency

**Governance & Administration:**
1. **Proposal Creation**: Create multisig proposals for critical operations
2. **Timelock Queue**: Critical changes enter timelock queue with appropriate delays
3. **Role Management**: Grant/revoke granular permissions to administrators
4. **Emergency Response**: Temporary roles for crisis management with auto-expiration

🔧 Configuration
Key protocol parameters:

Loan-to-Value (LTV): Maximum borrowable percentage of collateral value (75%)
Liquidation Threshold: Health factor trigger for liquidations (80%)
Liquidation Penalty: Bonus percentage for liquidators (5%)
Base Borrow Rate: Minimum interest rate when utilization is 0% (0%)
Optimal Utilization: Target utilization for rate calculations (80%)
Protocol Fee: Percentage of interest collected by protocol (10%)
Security Buffer: 5% safety margin below maximum LTV ratios
Minimum Health Factor: 1.1 (10% above liquidation threshold)

🌐 Network Support
Local Solana Network: For development and testing
Devnet: For testnet deployment and integration testing
Mainnet Beta: For production deployment (pending security audit)

## 💻 SDK Usage

### Basic Protocol Operations
```typescript
import { AuraLendClient } from '@aura-lend/sdk';
import { Connection, Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';

// Initialize client
const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com');
const wallet = new Wallet(Keypair.generate());
const client = new AuraLendClient({
  connection,
  wallet,
  programId: new PublicKey('AuRa1Lend1111111111111111111111111111111111')
});

// Deposit USDC to earn yield
const depositTx = await client.lending.depositLiquidity({
  reserve: usdcReservePubkey,
  amount: 1000_000_000, // 1000 USDC (6 decimals)
  userTokenAccount: userUsdcAccount,
  userCollateralAccount: userAusdcAccount
});

// Borrow SOL against USDC collateral  
const borrowTx = await client.borrowing.borrowLiquidity({
  obligation: userObligationPubkey,
  reserve: solReservePubkey,
  amount: 5_000_000_000, // 5 SOL (9 decimals)
  userTokenAccount: userSolAccount
});

// Monitor position health
const obligation = await client.getObligation(userPubkey);
const healthFactor = obligation.calculateHealthFactor();
console.log(`Health Factor: ${healthFactor}`);
```

### 🔐 RBAC & Governance Operations
```typescript
// Multi-Signature Operations
await client.multisig.createProposal({
  operationType: 'UpdateReserveConfig',
  targetAccounts: [reserveAccount],
  instructionData: configUpdateData,
  expiresAt: futureTimestamp
});

await client.multisig.signProposal(proposalPubkey);
await client.multisig.executeProposal(proposalPubkey);

// Timelock Operations  
await client.timelock.createTimelockProposal({
  operationType: 'UpdateMarketOwner',
  instructionData: newOwnerData,
  targetAccounts: [marketAccount]
  // Delay automatically calculated based on operation criticality
});

// Execute after delay period
await client.timelock.executeTimelockProposal(timelockProposalPubkey);

// Role Management
await client.governance.grantRole({
  holder: adminPubkey,
  roleType: 'ReserveManager',  
  permissions: ['RESERVE_MANAGER'],
  expiresAt: oneYearFromNow
});

// Check permissions
const hasPermission = await client.governance.checkPermission(
  adminPubkey, 
  'RESERVE_MANAGER'
);

// Emergency role granting (by emergency authority)
await client.governance.emergencyGrantRole({
  holder: responderPubkey,
  roleType: 'EmergencyResponder',
  expiresAt: twentyFourHoursFromNow
});
```

## 📊 Interest Rate Model

Kinked interest rate model with utilization-based calculations:

```
Utilization Rate = Total Borrowed / (Total Borrowed + Available Liquidity)

If Utilization <= Optimal (80%):
  Borrow Rate = Base Rate + (Utilization / Optimal) × Multiplier

If Utilization > Optimal:  
  Borrow Rate = Base Rate + Multiplier + (Excess Utilization / (100% - Optimal)) × Jump Multiplier

Supply Rate = Borrow Rate × Utilization × (1 - Protocol Fee)
```

## 🏛️ Enterprise Governance Architecture

### 🔐 Multi-Signature Control
- **Threshold Signatures**: Configurable 1-of-10 multisig with customizable thresholds
- **Proposal Lifecycle**: Create → Sign → Execute with full auditability
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce-based system preventing duplicate executions
- **Expiration Control**: Time-limited proposals with automatic cleanup

### ⏰ Timelock Mechanisms
| Operation Type | Delay Period | Examples |
|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Critical** | 7 days | Market owner changes, protocol upgrades |
| **High Priority** | 3 days | Emergency authority updates, major config changes |
| **Medium Priority** | 1 day | Reserve configurations, oracle updates |
| **Low Priority** | 6 hours | Fee adjustments, new reserve additions |

📖 How It Works

**Core Protocol Flow:**
1. **Market Initialization**: Deploy global protocol with multi-signature governance
2. **RBAC Setup**: Initialize multisig, timelock controller, and governance registry  
3. **Reserve Creation**: Initialize asset-specific liquidity pools (requires role permissions)
4. **Liquidity Provision**: Users deposit assets and receive yield-bearing aTokens
5. **Collateral Deposits**: Users deposit aTokens as collateral for borrowing
6. **Borrowing**: Take loans against collateral value with health factor monitoring
7. **Interest Accrual**: Dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand utilization
8. **Liquidation**: Automated liquidation of unhealthy positions to maintain protocol solvency

**Governance & Administration:**
1. **Proposal Creation**: Create multisig proposals for critical operations
2. **Timelock Queue**: Critical changes enter timelock queue with appropriate delays
3. **Role Management**: Grant/revoke granular permissions to administrators
4. **Emergency Response**: Temporary roles for crisis management with auto-expiration

🔧 Configuration
Key protocol parameters:

Loan-to-Value (LTV): Maximum borrowable percentage of collateral value (75%)
Liquidation Threshold: Health factor trigger for liquidations (80%)
Liquidation Penalty: Bonus percentage for liquidators (5%)
Base Borrow Rate: Minimum interest rate when utilization is 0% (0%)
Optimal Utilization: Target utilization for rate calculations (80%)
Protocol Fee: Percentage of interest collected by protocol (10%)
Security Buffer: 5% safety margin below maximum LTV ratios
Minimum Health Factor: 1.1 (10% above liquidation threshold)

🌐 Network Support
Local Solana Network: For development and testing
Devnet: For testnet deployment and integration testing
Mainnet Beta: For production deployment (pending security audit)

## 💻 SDK Usage

### Basic Protocol Operations
```typescript
import { AuraLendClient } from '@aura-lend/sdk';
import { Connection, Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';

// Initialize client
const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com');
const wallet = new Wallet(Keypair.generate());
const client = new AuraLendClient({
  connection,
  wallet,
  programId: new PublicKey('AuRa1Lend1111111111111111111111111111111111')
});

// Deposit USDC to earn yield
const depositTx = await client.lending.depositLiquidity({
  reserve: usdcReservePubkey,
  amount: 1000_000_000, // 1000 USDC (6 decimals)
  userTokenAccount: userUsdcAccount,
  userCollateralAccount: userAusdcAccount
});

// Borrow SOL against USDC collateral  
const borrowTx = await client.borrowing.borrowLiquidity({
  obligation: userObligationPubkey,
  reserve: solReservePubkey,
  amount: 5_000_000_000, // 5 SOL (9 decimals)
  userTokenAccount: userSolAccount
});

// Monitor position health
const obligation = await client.getObligation(userPubkey);
const healthFactor = obligation.calculateHealthFactor();
console.log(`Health Factor: ${healthFactor}`);
```

### 🔐 RBAC & Governance Operations
```typescript
// Multi-Signature Operations
await client.multisig.createProposal({
  operationType: 'UpdateReserveConfig',
  targetAccounts: [reserveAccount],
  instructionData: configUpdateData,
  expiresAt: futureTimestamp
});

await client.multisig.signProposal(proposalPubkey);
await client.multisig.executeProposal(proposalPubkey);

// Timelock Operations  
await client.timelock.createTimelockProposal({
  operationType: 'UpdateMarketOwner',
  instructionData: newOwnerData,
  targetAccounts: [marketAccount]
  // Delay automatically calculated based on operation criticality
});

// Execute after delay period
await client.timelock.executeTimelockProposal(timelockProposalPubkey);

// Role Management
await client.governance.grantRole({
  holder: adminPubkey,
  roleType: 'ReserveManager',  
  permissions: ['RESERVE_MANAGER'],
  expiresAt: oneYearFromNow
});

// Check permissions
const hasPermission = await client.governance.checkPermission(
  adminPubkey, 
  'RESERVE_MANAGER'
);

// Emergency role granting (by emergency authority)
await client.governance.emergencyGrantRole({
  holder: responderPubkey,
  roleType: 'EmergencyResponder',
  expiresAt: twentyFourHoursFromNow
});
```

### 🔄 Program Upgrade Operations
```typescript
// Set upgrade authority to multisig
await client.upgrades.setUpgradeAuthority({
  newAuthority: multisigPubkey
});

// Create upgrade proposal (requires multisig)
await client.multisig.createUpgradeProposal({
  operationType: 'ProgramUpgrade',
  newProgramData: upgradedProgramBuffer,
  targetAccounts: [programAccount, programDataAccount]
});

// Upgrade program after timelock delay
await client.upgrades.upgradeProgram({
  programId: currentProgramId,
  bufferAccount: newProgramBuffer,
  upgradeAuthority: multisigAuthority
});

// Migrate account data after upgrade
await client.migration.migrateMarket({
  market: marketAccount,
  authority: upgradeAuthority
});

// Batch migrate multiple reserves
await client.migration.batchMigrateReserves({
  market: marketAccount,
  reserves: [reserve1, reserve2, reserve3]
});

// Migrate user obligations
await client.migration.migrateObligation({
  obligation: userObligationAccount,
  owner: userPubkey
});

// Check migration compatibility
const isCompatible = await client.migration.validateMigrationCompatibility(
  currentVersion,
  targetVersion
);

// Freeze program permanently (emergency only)
await client.upgrades.freezeProgram({
  authority: emergencyAuthority
});
```

## 📊 Interest Rate Model

Kinked interest rate model with utilization-based calculations:

```
Utilization Rate = Total Borrowed / (Total Borrowed + Available Liquidity)

If Utilization <= Optimal (80%):
  Borrow Rate = Base Rate + (Utilization / Optimal) × Multiplier

If Utilization > Optimal:  
  Borrow Rate = Base Rate + Multiplier + (Excess Utilization / (100% - Optimal)) × Jump Multiplier

Supply Rate = Borrow Rate × Utilization × (1 - Protocol Fee)
```

## 🔄 **Program Upgradability Architecture**

### 🎯 Upgrade System Overview
The Aura Lend protocol implements a **comprehensive upgradability system** built on Solana's BPF Loader Upgradeable, providing:

- **Zero-Downtime Upgrades**: Seamless program updates without service interruption
- **Data Migration**: Automated account structure migration between versions
- **Governance Control**: MultiSig + Timelock protection for all upgrade operations
- **Version Validation**: Comprehensive compatibility checks preventing invalid upgrades
- **Rollback Protection**: Built-in safeguards against downgrades and breaking changes

### 🏗️ Upgrade Components

#### **1. BPF Loader Upgradeable Integration**
```rust
// Native Solana upgrade support via BPF Loader Upgradeable
pub fn upgrade_program(ctx: Context<UpgradeProgram>) -> Result<()> {
    // Validate upgrade authority (must be MultiSig)
    // Execute program upgrade with governance controls
    // Update program data account with new bytecode
}
```

#### **2. Version Management System**
```rust
pub trait Migratable {
    fn version(&self) -> u8;
    fn migrate(&mut self, from_version: u8) -> Result<()>;
    fn needs_migration(&self) -> bool;
}

// All state structures implement Migratable
impl Migratable for Market { ... }
impl Migratable for Reserve { ... }
impl Migratable for Obligation { ... }
```

#### **3. Data Migration Framework**
- **Account-Level Migration**: Individual account structure upgrades
- **Batch Migration**: Efficient bulk migration of multiple accounts
- **Version Compatibility**: Validation preventing invalid migration paths
- **Rollback Safety**: Protection against destructive migrations

### 🔐 Upgrade Security Model

#### **Authority Hierarchy**
1. **MultiSig Wallet** → **Upgrade Authority** (owns program upgrade capability)
2. **Timelock Controller** → **Delayed Execution** (7-day delay for critical upgrades)
3. **Governance Registry** → **Permission Validation** (ProgramUpgradeManager role required)

#### **Security Controls**
| Security Layer | Implementation | Protection |
|----------------|---------------|------------|
| **MultiSig Required** | 3-of-5 signatures minimum | Eliminates single point of failure |
| **7-Day Timelock** | Critical upgrade delay | Prevents rushed malicious upgrades |
| **Version Validation** | Compatibility checks | Blocks invalid upgrade paths |
| **Migration Testing** | Dry-run validation | Prevents data corruption |
| **Emergency Freeze** | Permanent upgrade disable | Ultimate protection mechanism |

### 📋 Upgrade Process Workflow

#### **Phase 1: Program Development & Testing**
```bash
# 1. Develop new program version
anchor build --program-name aura-lend-v2

# 2. Deploy to buffer account
solana program deploy --buffer <buffer-keypair> target/deploy/aura_lend.so

# 3. Test upgrade on devnet
npm run test:upgrade-devnet
```

#### **Phase 2: Governance Proposal**
```typescript
// 1. Create MultiSig proposal for upgrade
await client.multisig.createProposal({
  operationType: 'ProgramUpgrade',
  instructionData: upgradeInstructionData,
  targetAccounts: [programAccount, bufferAccount]
});

// 2. Collect signatures from MultiSig signatories
await client.multisig.signProposal(proposalPubkey);

// 3. Execute proposal (enters 7-day timelock)
await client.multisig.executeProposal(proposalPubkey);
```

#### **Phase 3: Timelock & Migration**
```typescript
// 1. Wait for 7-day timelock delay
await waitForTimelockDelay(timelockProposal);

// 2. Execute upgrade after delay
await client.timelock.executeTimelockProposal(timelockPubkey);

// 3. Migrate account data to new structure
await client.migration.migrateAllAccounts({
  market: marketAccount,
  reserves: reserveAccounts,
  obligations: obligationAccounts
});
```

### 🛠️ Migration Utilities

#### **Automated Scripts**
```bash
# Deploy upgrade to production
npm run deploy:upgrade:mainnet

# Migrate all protocol accounts
npm run migrate:accounts:mainnet

# Validate migration success
npm run validate:migration:mainnet

# Emergency rollback (if needed)
npm run emergency:freeze:mainnet
```

#### **SDK Integration**
```typescript
// Check if account needs migration
const needsMigration = await client.migration.checkMigrationNeeded(accountPubkey);

// Migrate specific account
await client.migration.migrateAccount(accountPubkey);

// Validate migration success
const migrationStatus = await client.migration.validateMigration(accountPubkey);
```

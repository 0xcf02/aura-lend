📖 How It Works
Market Initialization: Deploy global protocol configuration with supported assets
Reserve Creation: Initialize asset-specific liquidity pools with interest rate models
Liquidity Provision: Users deposit assets and receive yield-bearing aTokens
Collateral Deposits: Users deposit aTokens as collateral for borrowing
Borrowing: Take loans against collateral value with health factor monitoring
Interest Accrual: Dynamic interest rates based on supply and demand utilization
Liquidation: Automated liquidation of unhealthy positions to maintain protocol solvency
Security Layer: Multi-layered protection against common DeFi exploits

🔧 Configuration
Key protocol parameters:

Loan-to-Value (LTV): Maximum borrowable percentage of collateral value (75%)
Liquidation Threshold: Health factor trigger for liquidations (80%)
Liquidation Penalty: Bonus percentage for liquidators (5%)
Base Borrow Rate: Minimum interest rate when utilization is 0% (0%)
Optimal Utilization: Target utilization for rate calculations (80%)
Protocol Fee: Percentage of interest collected by protocol (10%)
Security Buffer: 5% safety margin below maximum LTV ratios
Minimum Health Factor: 1.1 (10% above liquidation threshold)

🌐 Network Support
Local Solana Network: For development and testing
Devnet: For testnet deployment and integration testing
Mainnet Beta: For production deployment (pending security audit)

## 💻 SDK Usage

```typescript
import { AuraLendClient } from '@aura-lend/sdk';
import { Connection, Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';

// Initialize client
const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com');
const wallet = new Wallet(Keypair.generate());
const client = new AuraLendClient({
  connection,
  wallet,
  programId: new PublicKey('AuRa1Lend1111111111111111111111111111111111')
});

// Deposit USDC to earn yield
const depositTx = await client.lending.depositLiquidity({
  reserve: usdcReservePubkey,
  amount: 1000_000_000, // 1000 USDC (6 decimals)
  userTokenAccount: userUsdcAccount,
  userCollateralAccount: userAusdcAccount
});

// Borrow SOL against USDC collateral  
const borrowTx = await client.borrowing.borrowLiquidity({
  obligation: userObligationPubkey,
  reserve: solReservePubkey,
  amount: 5_000_000_000, // 5 SOL (9 decimals)
  userTokenAccount: userSolAccount
});

// Monitor position health
const obligation = await client.getObligation(userPubkey);
const healthFactor = obligation.calculateHealthFactor();
console.log(`Health Factor: ${healthFactor}`);
```

## 📊 Interest Rate Model

Kinked interest rate model with utilization-based calculations:

```
Utilization Rate = Total Borrowed / (Total Borrowed + Available Liquidity)

If Utilization <= Optimal (80%):
  Borrow Rate = Base Rate + (Utilization / Optimal) × Multiplier

If Utilization > Optimal:  
  Borrow Rate = Base Rate + Multiplier + (Excess Utilization / (100% - Optimal)) × Jump Multiplier

Supply Rate = Borrow Rate × Utilization × (1 - Protocol Fee)
```

## 🏛️ AURA Governance

- **Voting Rights**: Token-weighted governance for protocol parameters
- **Fee Distribution**: Revenue sharing with AURA token holders
- **Proposal System**: Community-driven protocol upgrades and changes
- **Staking Rewards**: Additional incentives for long-term token holders
